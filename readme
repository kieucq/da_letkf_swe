This is the data assimilation system designed for the shallow water equation
that uses the LETKF algorithm. The system is designed for the pedagogical
purposes, and no support is warranted. Users will take full responsibility 
for their use, so long as it is not for the commercial purposes.

NOTE: 
1. The system only supports PGI Fortran compiler at the moment. 
2. The SWE model has a hard-wired (nx,ny). Need to make it more flexible
3. Only a certain type of OSSE designs are supported (see run/run_letkf.sh)

Dir structureL
1. ini: dir that contains a cold start initialization for an ensemble of
        initital inputs

2. truth: dir that contains an truth created from a base run of the base model.
        This program will use an initial input and integrate the model with 
        time, output at some regular interval as the truth benchmark.

3. obs: dir contains the obs data that are created by running obs.exe. This 
        program will read the truth and add some perturbed white noise to
        the truth to mimic the real obs.

4. model: contains the shallow water equation model

5. letkf: contains the assimilation code that performs a data assimilation
        process.

6. ana: contains the analysis output

7. fsc: contains the forecast for each cycle.

8. ctl: contains the base run with no assimilation. This is needed to compare
        the roles of assimilation.

9. dig: contains some diagnostic calculations

10.bgd: contains the background backup after each assimilating cycle. 

11.utils: contains some ultility programs that do intermediate steps
